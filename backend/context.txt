Road Hazard Detection & Real-Time Alerts
Newbietech
October 13, 2025
Brief Description of the Idea / Solution
Indian roads often expose drivers to unmarked speed breakers, potholes, stalled vehicles, and
debris, posing a constant safety risk. Our solution leverages computer vision and geospatial
technologies to detect road hazards in near real-time. The system captures video frames
from dashcams, street cameras, or smartphones, detects hazards using deep learning models,
automatically blurs faces and license plates to ensure privacy, and geotags each event. Using
the Haversine formula, the system calculates distances between hazards and vehicles to
eliminate duplicate alerts.
All detected hazards are dynamically maintained in a central database. If a hazard (e.g.,
pothole) is removed from the road, it is automatically removed from the database unless a
new hazard appears at the same location. Users can also report hazards through a portal by
uploading a photo along with latitude and longitude coordinates. This ensures continuous
real-time monitoring and database updating for accurate and reliable hazard information.
Additionally, all hazards are visualized on a GIS mapusing OpenStreetMap (OSM)for
navigation, monitoring, and analytics.

Impact of the Solution / Unique Selling Point (USP)
• Real-time hazard alerts for drivers to avoid accidents
• Privacy-preserving via automatic blurring of faces and license plates
• Duplicate-free notifications using Haversine distance filtering
• Low-latency edge and cloud processing
• Dynamic database updates: hazards removed from the road are automatically deleted
unless a new hazard appears
• User-submitted hazard reporting via portal with GPS and photo
• GIS visualization using OpenStreetMap for navigation, monitoring, and analytics
• Scalable data-driven insights for road maintenance
Haversine Formula for Distance Calculation
The distance d between two points on Earth with coordinates ( ϕ1, λ1) and (ϕ2, λ2) is calcu-
lated as:
d = 2r · arcsin
 r
sin2
∆ϕ


+ cosϕ1 · cos ϕ2 · sin2

!
where:
• r = 6371 km is the Earth’s radius
• ∆ϕ = ϕ2 − ϕ1
• ∆λ = λ2 − λ1

Training Data for Hazard Detection
Currently, publicly available datasets for road hazards are limited. Options for training
YOLOv8 or similar models include:
• Pothole Datasets: Kaggle and GitHub datasets containing annotated potholes.
• Road Damage Detection Dataset (RDD2020):Annotated cracks, potholes, and
road damages (used in competitions).
• Custom Dashcam / User-Submitted Data:Images uploaded via portal or dash-
cam footage can be labeled for training.
• Synthetic Data Augmentation: Overlay potholes, debris, or speed breakers on
clean road images to increase training diversity.
